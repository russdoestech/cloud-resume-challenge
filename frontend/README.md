# Frontend Technical Specification

- Create a static website that serves an html resume.

## Resume format considerations

- Structured with a regionally (US) relevant layout, such as:
  
  -- Objective

  -- Experience

  -- Certifications

  -- Education

- US resumes should not contain address, photo, or hobbies/interests
- Hobbies, interests, and a photo can be presented on a related website


### Resume Template


I'm comfortable with HTML, but don't feel like generating the HTML and CSS by hand, so I'll be using AI to generate the HTML and CSS and will modify as needed.

Prompt:
```
Convert this resume format into HTML
Use the least amount of CSS tags
```

This is the [generated output](./docs/nov-22-2025_resume_template_minimal.html), which I will refactor.

##HTML Adjustments

- UTF8 supports most languages. I'm only concerned with English.
- Since I want the resume to view correctly on a mobile device, I'll include the viewpoort meta tag wideth=device-width so mobile styling scales normally.
- I'll extract my styles into its own sylesheet once I'm happy with the HTML markup.
